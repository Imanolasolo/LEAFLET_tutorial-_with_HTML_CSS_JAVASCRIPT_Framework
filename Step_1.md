## 1st step (index.html)

To build our project, at first stage is to build the HTML page where the map and interactions will appear.

To make it possible, we opened a basic HTML template that we have in our local storage and modify it to build the base of the project.

See the codebase below:

```
<!--LEAFLET Tutorial with HTML CSS and JavaScript Framework-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--Define html dependencies-->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">    
	<!--Title for web and Html-->
    <title>LEAFLET Tutorial with HTML CSS and JavaScript Framework</title>
    <h1>LEAFLET Tutorial with HTML CSS and JavaScript Framework</h1>		
</head>
<body>
	 
	</body>

</html>

```
Code Explanation:

1.- We open the HTML codebase "telling to the system" what coding language we will use with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and what language we will talk with `<html lang="en">`

2.- We create the dependences or "conditions" like `charset (UTF-8)`, Compatibility with the latest Internet Explorer `(meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge")` and Responsive Viewport `(meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")`

3.- We provide the titles of web page `<title>LEAFLET Tutorial with HTML CSS and JavaScript Framework</title>` and title to Watch while we execute it `<h1>LEAFLET Tutorial with HTML CSS and JavaScript Framework</h1>` .

All this data and more (as we will check later) are included into the `<head>...</head>` group, telling the system that those instructions are to modify the HTML functioning.

4.- Check for `<body>...</body>` tags, here will appear the codebase for web page content.

5.- We close the HTML code with `</html>` tag

This is the basic explanation about how a n HTML page works. In next steps we will cover the most advanced aspects.
