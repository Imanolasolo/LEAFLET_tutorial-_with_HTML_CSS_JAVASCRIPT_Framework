## 2nd step (style.css)

Now we will give "some style" to our HTML page creating a .css page where we will modufy the HTML created objects.

1.- We started changing the attributes of the content Title (modifying h1 object)

2.- We paint it blue with `color:darkblue;`

3.- We changed font- family with `font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;`

4.- We aligned the text in the center of the page with `text-align: center`

Later we will add more style to a different objects that will appear in the project.
